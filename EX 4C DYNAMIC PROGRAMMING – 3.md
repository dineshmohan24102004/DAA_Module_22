# EX 4C DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING â€“ 3
## DATE:
## AIM:
Given a sequence, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in it.





## Algorithm
Start the program.

Input a string seq.

Reverse the string and store it as s2.

Define a 2D array dp[1001][1001] initialized with -1 for memoization.

Define a recursive function lps(s1, s2, n1, n2) that:

Returns 0 if n1 == 0 or n2 == 0.

If already computed, return dp[n1][n2].

If s1[n1-1] == s2[n2-1], store 1 + lps(s1, s2, n1-1, n2-1) in dp[n1][n2].

Otherwise, store max(lps(s1, s2, n1-1, n2), lps(s1, s2, n1, n2-1)) in dp[n1][n2].

Return the result.

Call lps(seq[::-1], seq, n, n) to compute the LPS length.

Print the result.

Stop the program.
